First, when 2 users click the "Start" button, they will have to enter their name so that the program can save their name and calculate their points. After that, the table and balls will appear and they can start to play. The rule is the same as an eight-ball pool game. After the game begins, the first player will cue the white ball to start the game. After that, players will take turns cueing the ball to get it in the hole. To cue the ball, the players will move the mouse to determine how much force they want to apply. They can also rotate the cue using the mouse.
